In this routing project, we have few scenarios

s1:
basic routing,home page implementation
for routing every project should have app folder, under this folder all the page.js / page.tsx will act as route

s2: 
create 2 pages for about and profile.
create a about folder under app, create a page.tsx. this page will be served when run the app alogn with
"/about"

create a profile folder under app, create a page.tsx. this page will be served when run the app alogn with
"/profile"

s3: neseted routing, we use blog folder for this,
we trying to acheive 
localhost:3000/blog/first, localhost:3000/blog/second

s4: passing data from url and reading in the components
for the baove scenario, we have used products folder
inorder to pass the and read those props, [productId] this format is used so that next js understands that
it is for passing data
